**I.	ATV fatalities trends across the U.S.**

[VIZ 1] *Choropleth map – Variations - per capita* 


Data shows that in 2017 the state with the most ATV-related deaths is West Virginia at 11.3 per capita. Followed by Alaska at 7.7 deaths per capita and Montana at 6.3 deaths per capita. 

According to, [Safe Kids Worldwide](https://www.safekids.org/), published data analysis, “the rate of ATV injury decreased by 26 percent among female children but only 12 percent among males” from 2011-2022. This information begs for state legislation to create new age requirements for ATV users. 

Additionally, all ATV riders should be wearing helmets and other protection gear. Furthermore, The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises against off-road vehicle use by children under 16.

**II.	ATVs and Saftey Legislation**

</script>


***Helmet/Eye Protection***

[VIZ 2] *Bar Chart – Problems & Solutions -percentage* 

The visual above shows that states without mandatory helmet and eye protection laws have 23% more fatalities than states with these laws. 

In [*Today*](https://www.today.com/parents/atv-safety-kids-aunt-boy-who-died-atv-warns-parents-t185855) article published supports the findings in sharing that 80-90 percent of ATV deaths victims were not wearing helmets.  

*Safe Kids Worldwide* published, collective data on ATV accidents illustrate the most common body parts injured while operating ATVs. The two most common body parts injured are head/neck making up 35 percent and upper extremities making up 40 percent of all body parts in these motor vehicle accidents. 


<iframe title="Safety Certificate Required " aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-3bA0H" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3bA0H/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="190" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

***Safety Certificate***

[VIZ 3] Bar Chart – Problems & Solutions - percentage

There is a 30% increase among reported deaths in states that do not require safety certification.

*Today* article identifies the dangers of ATVs – for children. Simply putting parents and guardians of children who claim that their children don’t ride ATVs are those most at risk and should be advised to educate their children of the vehicle’s safety measures.

Also, *Safe Kids Worldwide* advise that all riders ATV take a “hands on safety training course” and “read and follow the operator’s manual and warning labels” before attempting to ride theses motor vehicle.

**III. Conclusion**
Looking at our findings, West Virginia with the highest rate of ATV fatalities does in fact require helmet/eye protection, as well as safety certification. Despite the findings of reduced death rates in states with these requirements, West Virginia displays some sort of anomaly to the data’s findings. This begs the question: Why are ATV death rates in West Virginia significantly higher than other states, despite safety enforcements for ATV usage? 

As ATV become more and more popular, state legislations must make updates to improve their requirements, in order, to protect all motor vehicle users and thus further avoid increasing rates of ATVs and their deadly consequences when operating the machinery. 

**IV.	Methodology**  
The first step was to gather data sources. The selected data for the story includes:
1. 2017 Population (to calculate per capita) which was obtained by the United States Census Bureau.
2. 2021 Report of Deaths and Injuries Involving Off-Highway Vehicles with More than Two Wheels evaluated by U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission had limited years of data mostly consisting of 2016-2018 reports. 
3. STATE ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS published by Specialty Vehicle Institute of America displays a messy data set which I picked apart to create a story from my data analysis. 

The second step was use formulas to calculate the data questions for the story to cover. To find per capita use:
*= (Reported Death/ State Population) *1000**
 
The third step was section out and specify my findings.This approach involved creating pivot tables. The pivot tables created used:
- Values–Sum Reported Deaths and Sum State Population 
- Columns–Values 
- Rows– Safety Certification and Helmet/Eye Protection 

There should only one row per pivot table. Next, copy and paste special values only for each table. After the calculate per capita for both tables are then used to find percent difference, or the rate. An issue occurred when calculating stats on the minimum age requirements. The issue in this table’s calculations came from the vast separation between age requirements. Due to the lack of time, I left out minimum age in the visual created for the story because I would need to spend more time going back through the data to divide and group up the different age requirements, so I didn’t end up creating a viz for minimum age requirement table.  

The fourth and final step of the data analysis was to create the data visuals for the story. In this step I used DataWrapper to create three dataviz from the excel sheets used to gather data.
